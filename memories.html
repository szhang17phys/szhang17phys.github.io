		on ProtoDUNE PDS Sim/Reco working group. The topic is Michel electron optical signal 
		based on protoDUNE-HD, which can be regarded as the end of feasibility exploration of thesis research. For my thesis, I plan to 
		focus on Michel electron from cosmic muons. Firstly observe Michel electron signal in PDS, then reconstruct the energy of 
		Michel electron with PDS & TPC joint information, hopefully to improve the energy accuracy.
